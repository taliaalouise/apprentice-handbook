## Introduction

Searching algorithms are used to determine whether or not a certain value is in an array, and where that value is. There are only two commonly used searching algorithms used on arrays, Linear and Binary search.

## Linear Search

Going one by one along a list of items until you find what you're looking for.

[Code sample](../programming-in-java/07-sample-code.md#linear-search).

## Binary Search

Dividing sorted data into halves, discarding the unnecessary halves, until you
find what you're looking for. Ex. Finding a name in a phone book.
