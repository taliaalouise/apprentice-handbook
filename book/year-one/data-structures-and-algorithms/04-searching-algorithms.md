## Linear Search

Going one by one along a list of items until you find what you're looking for.

[Code sample](../programming-in-java/07-sample-code#linear-search).

## Binary Search

Dividing sorted data into halves, discarding the unnecessary halves, until you
find what you're looking for. Ex. Finding a name in a phone book.
