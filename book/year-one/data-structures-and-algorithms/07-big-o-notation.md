# Big-O Notation

"Big-O" notation is a way of describing how efficient an algorithm is, i.e. how many steps it takes to complete its task.

It is written in the form `O(maths)`, with the maths describing how the number of steps increases as the size of the input increases.

### Common O-notations

`O(1)`: Constant - The algorithm will take the same amount of time no matter how large the input is

`O(log(n))`: Logarithmic - The bigger the input, the slower the time taken grows \(e.g. input goes from 1-2, takes twice as long, input goes from 100-200, still takes twice as long\)
