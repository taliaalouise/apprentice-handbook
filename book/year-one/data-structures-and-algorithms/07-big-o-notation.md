# Big-O Notation

"Big-O" notation is a way of describing how efficient an algorithm is, or its "order". It is written in the form


$$
O(maths)
$$


with the maths describing how the time the algorithm takes increases as the size of the input increases.

### Common O-notations

$$O(1)$$: Constant - The algorithm will take the same amount of time no matter how large the input is

$$O(log(n))$$: Logarithmic - The bigger the input, the slower the time taken grows \(e.g. input goes from 1-2, takes twice as long, input goes from 100-200, still takes twice as long\)
