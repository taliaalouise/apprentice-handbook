## Trees

Non-linear, hierarchical data structure. Like a family tree.

Tree begin at a root node, which has child nodes -> child nodes are roots of their own subtrees. Example: the computerâ€™s directory system is a tree.

**Internal node** - child with at least one child

**External node** - child without any children

**Depth** - number of ancestors a node has, i.e. how far down in the tree it is

**Degree** - number of children of a node

**Height** - maximum depth of any node

**Traversal**:
* **Pre order** - process when you pass down left side of node
* **In order** - process when you pass underneath node
* **Post order** - process when you pass up right side of node

### Binary Trees

A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children. A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list.
