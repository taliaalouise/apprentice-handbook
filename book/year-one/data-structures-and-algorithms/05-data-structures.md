## Arrays

An array is a list of elements all of the same data type (e.g. all integers or all strings, not a mixture). 

Each item in the list has an index, which describes its location in the list. The indexes begin at 0. 

For example, this shopping list is an array containing strings:

**Index**  | 0        | 1        | 2        | 3        | 4        
-----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------
**Value**  | "Apples" | "Bread"  | "Milk"   | "Corn"   | "Butter" 

### Finding items by index

You can get items in an array by *looking up* their index.

For example, you can find the first item with the expression `arrayName[0]` (remember, the first item is index 0). `arrayName[4]` would return "Butter" in the example above.

### Arrays in Java

#### Arrays in Java are static

Arrays in java are static. This means they are of fixed length. The length is specified when you initialise the array. 

This does not mean the array needs to be 'full' (i.e. have an item stored at each index). However, an array can never exceed its initial length and any attempt to add items beyond this maximum will cause an error.

#### Java code example

```java
int[] grade = new int[3]; // Create an empty array of size 3 to store integers.
// OR you can initialise an array with values.
int[] grade = {87, 93, 35}; //Create an array populated with 3 integer values

System.out.println( grade[0] ); // Prints 87, the item at index 0 in the list.
System.out.println( grade.length ); // Prints 3. There are 3 items in the list
```

## 2D Arrays (Grid-like)

A 2D array is an array made up of arrays. It can be visualised as a grid or table (e.g. Excel spreadsheet).

### Examples
Digital images are 2D arrays. Each pixel is a cell in the grid.

### In Java
```java
int rows = 3;
int columns = 4;
double[][] scores = new double[rows][columns]; // Defines a 3x4 table or grid
```

You can access an item in a 2D array using the row and column index, ```arrayName[rowNum][colNum]``` e.g. ```arrayName[0][0]``` is the first item in the first array (in the top left of the grid). 

For the java code above, we could access the value in each cell as follows:

**Indexes**  | 0             | 1            | 2             | 3             
:-----------:|---------------|--------------|---------------|--------------
**0**        | scores[0]\[0] |scores[0]\[1] | scores[0]\[2] | scores[0]\[3] 
**1**        | scores[1]\[0] |scores[1]\[1] | scores[1]\[2] | scores[1]\[3] 
**2**        | scores[2]\[0] |scores[2]\[1] | scores[2]\[2] | scores[1]\[3] 

## Stacks

A stack is a data structure where data is added or removed at one end only. This end is called the top. Imagine a stack of trays in caffeteria. A stack is: Last in, first out (**LIFO**).

### Stack operations in java

`push(x)`
Adds *x* to the top of the stack.

`pop()`
Remove one element from the top. This operation takes no parameter. It can only take the top item.

`size()`
Returns the number of elements in a stack.

`empty()`
Returns boolean, true if stack is empty.

`peek()`
Return top item without removing it from the stack.Imagine peeking at the first card in a deck of cards.

### Stacks are dynamic

Stacks need not be of fixed size. Stacks can shrink and grows as items are added or removed. You can, however, choose to make a stack with a maximum size, but this can cause errors e.g. stack overflow - see below.

### Stack Errors

#### Stack overflow
`push(x)` to a full (fixed size) stack will cause an error.

#### Stack underflow
`pop()` (or `peek()`) to an empty stack.

## Queues

Queues in computer are like human queues, items are added at one end and remove from the other. Queues are first in, first out (**FIFO**).

### Queue operations

`enqueue(x)`
Add *x* to the back of the queue.

`dequeue()`
Remove the item at the front of the queue. This takes no parameter, it can only access the front item.


## Trees

Non-linear, hierarchical data structure. Like a family tree.

Tree begin at a root node, which has child nodes -> child nodes are roots of their own subtrees. Example: the computerâ€™s directory system is a tree.

**Internal node** - child with at least one child

**External node** - child without any children

**Depth** - number of ancestors a node has, i.e. how far down in the tree it is

**Degree** - number of children of a node

**Height** - maximum depth of any node

**Traversal**:
* **Pre order** - process when you pass down left side of node
* **In order** - process when you pass underneath node
* **Post order** - process when you pass up right side of node

### Binary Trees

A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children. A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list.
