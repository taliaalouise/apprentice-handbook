## Introduction

Dynamic programming is a simple method of finding optimal solutions to complex problems. It allows you to compare possible solutions to find the most efficient.

### Typical problems

Dynamic programming can be applied to these *classic* programming problems.

#### [Travelling salesman](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)

A travelling salesman has to visit several cities, then return home. It doesn't matter what order she visits the cities in, she just wants to find the shortest possible journey.

Steps
Divide problem into stages
Make a decision at each stage
Decision leads to optimal state at each stage
Often starts at the last stage and work backwards
