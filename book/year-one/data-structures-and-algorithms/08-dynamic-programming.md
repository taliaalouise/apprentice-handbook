## Introduction

Dynamic programming is a simple method of finding optimal or most efficient solutions to complex problems. It does this by deriving final optimal solution from optimal solutions to ever simpler versions of the problem.

### Typical problems

Dynamic programming can be applied to these *classic* programming problems.

#### Travelling salesman

A travelling salesman has to visit several cities, then return home. It doesn't matter what order she visits the cities in, she just wants to find the shortest possible journey.

#### Knapsack

Steps
Divide problem into stages
Make a decision at each stage
Decision leads to optimal state at each stage
Often starts at the last stage and work backwards
