## Introduction

In computer science a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a
list in a certain order. We could say we want to sort it in one of two ways:
**ascending** or **descending**.

```js
[0, 1, 2, 4, 5] // Ascending order!
[5, 4, 2, 1, 0] // Descending order!
```

Below each title you will find the [complexity](07-big-o-notation.md). They are
there for future reference only.

## Bubble Sort

### Complexity: `Time: O(n²), Space: O(1)`

Compares an element to its neighbor, if the element is larger that its
neighbor, they swap places. The largest elements “bubble up” to the end with
each pass of the loop.

## Selection Sort

### Complexity: `Time: O(n²), Space: O(n)`

Compares an element against all the elements of the array until it finds the
smallest, then they swap places. Small elements get pushed to the beginning
with each pass of the loop.
