## Introduction

Here is some basic jargon / terminology you should understand.

## Terminology

- **Program**: A set of instructions to be carried out by a computer.
- **Program execution**: The act of carrying out / running of the instructions on the computer.
- **Programming language**: A systematic set of rules used to describe computations in a format editable by humans.
- **Syntax error**: Bad grammar in your program. E.g. missing brackets or semi-colons.
- **Execution error**: Sometimes called runtime error. Involves asking the computer to do the impossible (e.g. divide by 0) and will result in an error message.
- **Logical error**: Well formed program, but incorrect instructions. This might not raise an error message, your program might just not work as intended or have a surprising outcome.
- **IDE**: Integrated Development Environment. A piece of software you can use to write, compile, and execute code. Often includes helpful features, like auto-complete.
