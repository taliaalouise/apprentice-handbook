## Introduction
In computer science, data is grouped according to type. This chapter covers the naming conventions used for data types in Java.

Java is a statically typed programming language, meaning that what *kind* of data it is is as important as the data itself. In Java, when creating an `array`, declaring a `variable`, or making a `function`, you *must* declare the **type** before its name.

## Numbers

### Integer

Integers in computer science refer to whole numbers.

`100` - an integer

How to declare an integer in Java:
```java
int x = 100;
```

### Double

Doubles refer to numbers fixed to a point. Example: Decimal numbers

`1.50` - a double

How to declare a double in Java:

```java
double y = 1.50;
```
## Operands

Operands are symbols signifying a specific mathematical operation to be performed.

In this example, the operand `+` tells us to add the numbers `1` and `2` together:

```java
1 + 2
```

Some common operands:

`+` - addition of numbers, and concatenation of `Strings`

`-` - subtraction of numbers

`/` - division of numbers

`*` - multiplication of numbers

`=` - assigns a value. The value item on the left side becomes the value of the item on the right side.

`==` - strict equality. The value of the item on the left must be the same as the value of the item on the right side.

`%` - pronounced "modulo". Determines the remainder of dividing two numbers.

## Booleans

Booleans refer to items that evaluate to either `true` or `false`.

How to declare a boolean in Java:
```java
boolean sorted = false;
```

## Characters

A character refers to a single symbol between `''`. Notice the single quotation marks.

Examples of characters:

`'a'`

`'@'`

`'1'`

How to declare a character in Java:

```java
char letter = 'a';
```

## Strings

A `String` refers to a series of characters between `""`. It is most frequently used for holding text.

Examples of Strings:

`"abcde"`

`"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy brown dog"`

`"12345678"`

How to declare a string in Java:

```java
String talk = "blah blah blah";
```
