## Introduction

Agile is not a specific methodolgy. Unlike Waterfall, it does not prescribe a set way of working through the phases of SDLC.

It offers a set of principles that software developers can use to find solutions to their problems. It emphasises flexibilty and collaboration. It was [developed in 2001](http://agilemanifesto.org/history.html) when a group of software engineers met to discuss their craft.

At the heart of Agile is a 4 point manifesto and 12 guiding principles.

## Agile manifesto

[http://agilemanifesto.org/](http://agilemanifesto.org/)

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

## Agile principles

[http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)

* Highest priority: satisfy customer through early and continuous development of valuable software
* Welcome changes to requirements (even late on).
* Delivers working software frequently - e.g. fortnightly or monthly
* Business people and developers must work together daily
* Build projects around motivated individuals. Trust.
* Best way to convey information is face-to-face
* Working software is the measure of progress
* Sustainable development (i.e. consistent pace - avoid burnout)
* Emphasis on technical excellence and good design
* Simplicity: maximising the amount of work not done
* Self organising teams.
* At regular intervals teams reflects.

## Agile strengths

* Agile is adaptive not predictive. It is flexible.
* It fosters a transparent relationship with the client (e.g. regular meetings and early prototypes)
* Regular iteration allows lessons to be learnt
* Rapid move toward minimum viable product (MVP) means benefits realised early on
* Testing throughout improves quality
* Small incremental change reduces risk and allows errors to be spotted early
* More enjoyable (people over process, collaborative, active, etc...)

## Agile weaknesses

* Can be inefficient in large organisations - lots of decentralised decision making means economies of scale are lost.
* Projects can go off track if the customer is not clear on desired final outcome
* An excuse not to write documentation
* Often requires large changes to working practices, so can be difficult to implement
* Is demanding of the clientâ€™s time
* Makes it difficult to estimate budget
